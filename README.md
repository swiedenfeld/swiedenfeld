### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a Software Engineer located near DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. For more than ten years, I have helped clients build enterprise-grade, distributed systems that operate at scale.

Being an early millenial, computers and information technology fascinate me ever since I first typed BASIC programs from magazines into a Commodore C64. When internet/WWW emerged in the 1990s, web technologies immediately attracted my interest and I began writing software for the web. Meanwhile, I am a graduated computer scientist and work as a senior consultant.

I am looking forward to connect with you, especially if you work with anything Java and/or cloud providers (AWS, Azure). 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on client projects, which I cannot share publicly
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to contribute to Open Source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about consulting ... or anything related to Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS ..
