### Hi there 👋
I am a Software Engineer located near Düsseldorf, Germany.  

Being an early millenial, computers and information technology fascinate me ever since I first typed BASIC programs from magazines into a Commodore C64. When internet/WWW emerged in the 1990s, web technologies immediately attracted my interest and I began writing software for the web. Meanwhile, I am a graduated computer scientist and work as a senior consultant.

I am looking forward to connect with you, especially if you work with anything Java and/or cloud providers (AWS, Azure). 

- 🔭 I’m currently working on client projects, which I cannot share publicly
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Kotlin and Python
- 👯 I’m looking to contribute to Open Source projects
- 💬 Ask me about consulting ... or anything related to Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS ..
- 📫 How to reach me: [@saschagram](https://twitter.com/saschagram) on twitter
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him/his
