### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sascha. I am a Software Engineer located in Germany.

Computers fascinate me ever since I first typed BASIC programs from magazines into a Commodore C64. When internet/WWW emerged in the 1990s, I began writing websites with dynamic content. I studied Computer Science (MSc). Java has accompanied me ever since first semester.

I'm looking forward to connect with people working in software development to share and discuss experiences. Especially on these topics: Java, Kafka, AWS, Azure 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on client projects most of the time, which I cannot share publicly
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin and Python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to contribute to Open Source projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about consulting ... or anything related to Java, Spring Boot, Kafka, AWS ..
